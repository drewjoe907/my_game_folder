portals to other worlds, an underwater city, and military enlistment and 
military prison as normal game elements and settings.

### Object

champeenchip than it is about setting the sim conditions and discovering what stats those 
conditions generate.

save in a game screen called The Hall. For the current season in a particular 
save more comprehensive stats are tracked for player and team.

### Setting
The game is set in 1941 along the Red River where Texas, Louisana, Arkansas,
and Oklahoma conjoin. 

### The Game's World
The games horror elements are based on the very real horrors of life in this place 
and time. The sports elements are based on an alternate reality in which a basketball
league has attained here-to-for unseen level of organization. The League, called Greatest
Games, is comprised of four divisions, each with 5 teams. Each division is based around a 
fictional town:

In London, TX, the division is run by the ghosts of the basketball team that perished in 
the famous natural gas explosion at London Community College. 

In Uncertain, TX, the games are played in the swamp, and the courts held up by the hands of 
ancestors who are buried there.

In Gin City, AR the division is organized by, and played behind the walls of, the US Army Prison.

In London, LA a celestial dome protects the players and fans in the largely underwater town just
south of Lake Charles.

The playoffs and championship are held beneath Squid Ink Lake at the center of the Gulf of
Mexico.
